        <h1>Making a Game with Go: Interlude</h2>
        <p><html><head></head><body><p>In this short post you can read about <strong>why I switched from <a href="https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go" rel="nofollow">raylib-go</a> to <a href="https://github.com/faiface/pixel" rel="nofollow">Pixel</a></strong> for this tutorial series. If you don&#39;t mind you can safely skip this issue. Did I fall into the trap of needlessly starting over with another library instead of sticking to what I have? I think I made the right choice after reconsidering my requirements.</p>

Why ditch raylib-go?</h2>

<p>First let me say that I still think raylib is a great library. And if you write your game in C/C++ I still recommend it very much. But I want to write my game in Go and therefore have to use bindings. It&#39;s great that someone provides these bindings and they seem to be good quality code. However certain problems arise from the fact that raylib is <em>C first</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="api-changes" class="anchor" href="#api-changes" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
API changes</h3>

<p>raylib moves pretty fast and its API has not really settled. That means there is a lot of work for the maintainer of the bindings to keep up with those changes and thus the bindings are rarely up-to-date with the newest updates.</p>

Bugs &amp; improvements</h3>

<p>If you find a bug or want to improve on some functionality in raylib you can do that. But you have to do it in C first and then write the bindings in Go. That&#39;s a lot of work if you want to make a game at the same time.</p>

<p>I e.g. had the following problem with raylib.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/791374/39663240-fb0538c2-506f-11e8-9c14-213d3ed94cfe.gif" alt="orbiteer-jumpy"/></p>

<p>If you look at the movement of the planets you will recognize that it is a little <em>jumpy</em>. That comes from the fact that internally raylib casted floats to ints before drawing a sprite. I opened an <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues/527" rel="nofollow">issue</a> about it and it was resolved pretty quickly. However when it is updated in the Go bindings is unknown.</p>

Feels like C</h3>

<p>This one is a little subjective but you can still smell the C in the Go bindings. For example all of raylib&#39;s <code>float</code>s are translated with <code>float32</code>. This is very cumbersome because most parts of Go&#39;s standard library expect <code>float64</code> and you just have to cast values everywhere.</p>

Why Pixel?</h2>

<p>Last time I wrote that Pixel was a little to <em>beta-ish</em> and doesn&#39;t support mobile and web targets. Now I was right about the targets but to be honest for this project I don&#39;t really need them. And after re-evaluation of its capabilities and the code and submitting a pull request to Pixel I think I was a little wrong about the <em>beta-ish</em>. It&#39;s well thought out and seems solid so far.</p>

<p>Contributing something to the library was also a very smooth experience. And even if I want features that will not go into the official library I still can use them in my private fork.</p>

Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the end it&#39;s all about how easy it is for me to change things in the library. Therefore a library that is primarily written in / for Go is just a better choice. Ideally it should build on top of GLFW or SDL. They both are mature and have solid Go bindings.</p>

<p>I will give raylib another shot when the API has settled, maybe with the next major release.</p>

<p>If you want to see how far the game got before I stopped have a look <a href="https://github.com/dbriemann/orbiteer" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This project will now be discontinued and <a href="https://github.com/dbriemann/gonk" rel="nofollow">Gonk</a> will take its place. More on that in the next issue.</p>

<p>I already had written a large chunk of part 1 but rewriting it for Pixel should be pretty straightforward, so it shouldn&#39;t take to long for the first real tutorial issue. See you soon.</p>
